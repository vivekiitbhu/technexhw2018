		<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

		<h3>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).</h3>

		<p> Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications (or just 'web apps') electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. </p>

	<div class="container-fluid text-center bg-4">
		<h1>AS AN INDUSTRY</h1>

		<p>For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers deal with the layout and visuals of a website, while back-end developers deal with the functionality of a website. Back-end developers will program in the functions of a website that will collect data.</p>

		<h1>MOBILE RESPONSIVE</h1>
		<p>When a website is responsive, the layout and/or content responds or adapts based on the size of screen they are presented on.A responsive website automatically changes to fit the device you’re reading it on.Typically there have been four general screen sizes that responsive design has been aimed at: the widescreen desktop monitor, the smaller desktop (or laptop), the tablet and the mobile phone.<br />In short, you (publisher, developer, and designer) should care because you want the visitors to your website to have the best experience possible, without forcing them to adapt themselves.There are essentially two ways you can give your audience a good experience utilizing responsive design:</p>

		<h3>The first is optimizing the layout of the content.</h3>

		<P>If a user is browsing from a mobile phone, they generally don’t have a lot of screen real estate to work with. Phones today will typically zoom out automatically, so that the entire website can be seen onscreen. This can be good, as it gives the reader access to the entire site, but it can also be frustrating when trying to find information that is located in a tiny part of the upper right of the screen. If you could move some things around, make some things bigger and not have as many columns you’ll give your mobile reader a much better experience.</P>

		<h3>The second is to adapt the content that is shown.</h3>

		<p>If you own a restaurant and a potential customer is browsing your site from a mobile phone, chances are they aren’t that concerned with how pretty your site is — your foodie blog with the awesome slideshow of delectable dishes scrolling from side to side isn’t very useful in that situation. They want to know what your hours are, where you’re located, how to make reservations, and want a look at the menu.Your potential customer browsing from a desktop computer probably isn’t looking to eat right now, and isn’t in a hurry to see where you’re located and what your phone number is. Most likely he’s looking to see if you offer a good atmosphere and what types food are available.These are obviously generalizations but you can see the benefits of having differing content presented to people in different screen viewing circumstances.Mobile responsive design takes care of this all “on the fly”, and without multiple versions of your site to maintain.</p>

		<h1>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</h1>
		<p>Web application security is a branch of Information Security that deals specifically with security of websites, web applications and web services. At a high level, Web application security draws on the principles of application security but applies them specifically to Internet and Web systems.For more you can visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_security">here</a></p>
